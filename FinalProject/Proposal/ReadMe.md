What will (likely) be the title of your project?
Basic Equalizer

In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "My project is about creating a wavetable synthesizer.")
My project is about building an EQ using JUCE

In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
EQ is typically used to adjust various elements of user-generated music. For instance, it can emphasize or attenuate the frequencies of specific instruments to optimize the overall mix, highlight or suppress certain sounds, and more. 

If you are planning to combine EP-353's final project with another course's project, which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to EP-353, and which aspect(s) would connect to the other course?

In the software world, almost everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And it is not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.
In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
Creating an eq with a small number of features.

In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
Operation of eq with frequency-specific sequence adjustment.

In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
It includes frequency-specific sequence adjustments and allows analysis of the spectrum of music, including visual elements.

In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?
I have to look up the plugin header, and processor files in the JUCE module. And I should think and figure out how the plugin that Iâ€™ll make works.
