***The code(HelloWorld.c) is a simple program that prints "Hello, world" to the console. This is a common code to demonstrate the basic syntax of the programming language.***


*#include <stdio.h>*: This line includes the standard input/output library in C.

*int main()*: the main function where program execution begins.

*{}*: It is placed at the start and end of the main function's code block.

*printf("Hello, World!")*: This line uses the printf function to print the "Hello, World!" message to the console. 

*\n*: used to insert a new line for formatting.

When I	 compile and run the program, it will display "Hello, World!" on the console. 

When I change the text inside the double quotes("") in the printf function to something else, that new text will be displayed when you run the program. (displaying whatever text you provide within the double quotes.)
